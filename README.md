Pizza Sales Analysis
Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project repository! This project represents a significant step in my Data Analytics Series, focusing on extracting actionable insights from pizza sales data. Below, you'll find detailed information about the project, including the objectives, methodologies, and key findings.

üìÅ Project Overview
Pizza Sales Analysis
Objective: To analyze pizza sales data from multiple sources to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help understand customer preferences and sales dynamics.
Tools Used: SQL, pgAdmin
Key Learnings:
Joins: Merged data from various tables to create a cohesive dataset for comprehensive analysis.
Subqueries: Employed nested queries to handle complex data extraction tasks efficiently.
Ranking: Utilized ranking functions to identify top-performing products and trends.
Aggregate Functions: Leveraged aggregate functions to compute key metrics and summarize data effectively.
Project Description:
In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze data from four distinct CSV files: orders, order_details, pizza_types, and pizzas. The aim was to extract meaningful insights by addressing specific analytical questions.

üîç Key Tasks:

Data Integration: Combined data from multiple sources to create a unified view of the sales information.
SQL Query Development: Developed and executed SQL queries to address various analytical questions and generate insights.
Insights Extraction: Identified popular pizza types, peak order times, and customer preferences.
üìà Key Insights:

Popular Pizza Types: Analyzed which pizza types were most frequently ordered and their impact on overall sales.
Peak Order Times: Determined peak times for orders to understand customer behavior and optimize operations.
Customer Preferences: Examined order details to reveal customer preferences and trends in purchasing.
